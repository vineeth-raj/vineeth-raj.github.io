<h1>ESG based rating mechanism for investment decisions</h1>
<p>Investment Bank INV wants to create a new ESG-based fund. While there are ESG-based Index and stocks there are available in stock exchanges they are not giving a comprehensive view of stock ESG ratings. INV wants to build an ESG-based rating mechanism from the available corporate ESG publications and other publicly available information. How can you help them?</p>
