<h1>EV Charging station optimal placement</h1>
<p>EV adoption is set grow and Utilities are one of the central players for EV Infrastructure. To drive the growth there should be an alignment between charging stations and demand. Site selection is an important and complex process and driven by many factors. A utility company UTZ planning to establish EV charging stations at multiple places in India. How can we optimize charging station placement for them to drive customer experience and profitability?</p>
