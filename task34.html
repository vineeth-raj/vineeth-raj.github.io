<h1>Automatic Log Monitor</h1>
<p>In any application developers adds logs to monitor the progress and debug application if needed. Currently in market we have grafana , splunk to monitor logs and few more tools. However, challenge here is that it requires configuration, which with time requires update as well. This process can be replaced by one application which will automatically scan the application and get the logs to be monitored.</p>
