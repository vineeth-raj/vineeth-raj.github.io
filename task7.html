<p>Every bank has applications sharing files and the sizes are growing. Technologies could differ but performance improvements are always desired. Commercial solutions are available and may not fit budget for all banks/projects as well as not all features may be required. Create a rules based accelerator that uses multithreading, pre & post processing of records for faster processing files by consuming minimal resources</p>
