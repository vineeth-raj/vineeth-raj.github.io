<h1>Generate Proposal response to typical RFP floated by prospective and new customers</h1>
<p>Medium to large deals in typical areas like Managed services, ADM or Cloud Migrations have multi-practices along with vertical sales to create response to RFPs. Every time the deal participants create or copy paste responses from older RFPs, leading to non-standard and less innovative response. "Pursuit GPT" will enable the Gen AI model to ingest RFPs, deal insights created by Sales, use public domain content, company's Financial Statements, services offerings etc. to create innovative responses for such deals. Summarization feature will help reviewers and content creators to on-board quickly. Prompt engineering should help deal team to provide inputs specify and confine the responses. "Pursuit GPT" should be able to generate meaningful, contextual sections like our understanding, challenges, value adds and respective sections per practice for solution. This will help utilize the organization knowledge, standardize responses and help speed up the entire process and much much more</p>
