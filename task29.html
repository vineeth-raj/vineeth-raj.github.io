<h1>Legacy Modernization using Gen AI</h1>
<p>Legacy systems, which form the backbone of many enterprises, are holding back organizations from leveraging new digital technologies and creating new experiences for their customers, stakeholders, and partners. This transformation journey is filled with challenges - Complex and old legacy code are hard to understand & transform, Lack of skilled resources to carry out transformation, Transformation programs are time bound, hence its hard to meet the schedule and quality, lack of documentation. Gen AI's engineering capabilities can be used to tackle these challenges. Gen AI can be used to understand the legacy code, code conversion to modern frameworks, optimize the code and generate test cases using the Open AI APIs. Problem Statement: Migrating Mainframe CICS applications to Java / Angular using Gen AI Scope: We would be considering a simple CICS application with 3-4 screens(BMS) on CRUD operations for this and convert them with the help of Gen AI. The problem statement is to build a simple python based framework which will integrate with Gen AI Open APIs and achieve code transformation. Mainframe code will be provided for the resources who sign up for this challenge, along with Azure open API access.</p>
